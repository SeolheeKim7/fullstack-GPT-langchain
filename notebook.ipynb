Cover the container with a clean cloth or plastic wrap and let it ferment for about 7-10 days at room temperature.\\n8. After the fermentation period, strain the mixture through a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer to remove any solids.\\n9. If desired, add sugar to sweeten the soju. Stir well until the sugar dissolves completely.\\n10. Transfer the soju to clean bottles or jars and refrigerate for a few hours before serving.\\n11.
